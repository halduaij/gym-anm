# ðŸš¨ PROJECT GOAL: IEEE33 Offline RL Dataset Generation ðŸš¨

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL MISTAKES TO AVOID (LEARNED THE HARD WAY) ðŸ”´

### MISTAKE #1: Celebrating Zero Control Usage
**What I did wrong**: Created L5 that uses 0.000 MW and claimed it was "optimal"
**Why it's wrong**: A controller doing nothing means the test is too easy, NOT that the controller is good
**How to fix**: 
- Test with load_scale > 1.3 to create voltage drops
- Verify that doing nothing leads to violations
- Ensure all controllers MUST act to maintain safety

### MISTAKE #2: Misunderstanding High Action Costs
**What I did wrong**: Made L5 "win" by never acting when action costs were high
**Why it's wrong**: High action costs should encourage EFFICIENCY, not inactivity
**How to fix**:
- L5 should find the MINIMUM control needed for safety
- Use scipy.optimize to balance: `minimize(violation_penalty + action_cost)`
- Test should show L5 using less control than others, but NOT zero

### MISTAKE #3: Testing on Too-Easy Scenarios
**What I did wrong**: Used load_scale=1.0 where voltage naturally stays at 0.97+
**Why it's wrong**: Can't differentiate controller quality if no control is needed
**How to fix**:
- Always test with challenging scenarios:
  - High load: `env.load_scale = 1.5` 
  - Variable load: `lambda t: 0.8 + 0.6*sin(t)`
  - Check initial voltage without control: should be < 0.95

### CORRECT TESTING APPROACH:
```python
# 1. Create challenging environment
env = HighActionCostEnv(action_cost_multiplier=5.0)  # Not 10!
env.load_scale = 1.5  # High load that REQUIRES control

# 2. Verify challenge exists
env.reset()
# Do nothing for one step
zero_action = np.zeros(17)
zero_action[16] = 1.0  # OLTC neutral
obs, reward, _, _, _ = env.step(zero_action)
# Check voltage - should have violations!

# 3. L5 should show OPTIMAL control, not ZERO control
# Good L5: Uses 0.05-0.1 MW to maintain 0.95 < v < 1.05
# Bad L5: Uses 0.000 MW and has violations OR test is too easy
```

### UNDERSTANDING SCIPY L5 IMPLEMENTATION:
**Key insight**: IEEE33 is very robust - normal loads don't cause violations
- At 1.0x load: v_min â‰ˆ 0.97 (no control needed)
- At 2.0x load: v_min â‰ˆ 0.953 (still safe)
- Need 3x+ load or contingencies to require control

**Scipy L5 is CORRECT when it uses 0.000 MW if**:
1. Voltage naturally stays above 0.95
2. No violations occur
3. Action costs are high

**How to properly test scipy L5**:
1. Create scenarios where doing nothing â†’ violations
2. L5 should find MINIMAL control to prevent violations
3. Compare to other controllers: L5 should use less but not necessarily zero

**The original scipy L5 had wrong objective**:
- Had `curtailment_cost = 100` (penalized NOT using renewable)
- But environment penalizes ALL control usage
- Fixed version minimizes `violation_penalty + action_cost`

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: BEHAVIORAL DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS ðŸ”´

### What We Mean by "Diversity" for Offline RL:
**NOT THIS**: Controllers that differ only in violation rates (unsafe diversity)
**YES THIS**: Controllers that achieve safety through DIFFERENT strategies

### Required Behavioral Diversity:
1. **L0 (Random)**: Exploration baseline with violations
2. **L1 (Renewable-Only)**: Uses ONLY renewable, NO capacitors
3. **L2 (Capacitor-Only)**: Uses ONLY capacitors, NO renewable
4. **L3 (Conservative)**: Uses 50% renewable + 2 capacitors
5. **L4 (Aggressive)**: Uses 100% renewable + 4-6 capacitors
6. **L5 (Optimal)**: Uses scipy to find minimal effective control

### How to Verify True Diversity:
```python
# Check that controllers use DIFFERENT strategies:
for controller in controllers:
    stats = test_controller(controller)
    print(f"{name}:")
    print(f"  - Renewable: {stats['avg_renewable']:.3f} MW")
    print(f"  - Capacitors: {stats['avg_caps']} units")
    print(f"  - Strategy: {stats['strategy_description']}")
```

### Common Diversity Failures:
1. **L3, L4, L5 all converge to same solution** (e.g., all use 0.35 MW + 4 caps)
   - Fix: Force different constraints/objectives for each
   - L3: Limit to 2 capacitors maximum
   - L4: Must use ALL devices even if suboptimal
   - L5: Minimize total control usage

2. **All safe controllers use maximum renewable**
   - Fix: Vary load scenarios where different strategies excel
   - Low load: Capacitor-only might suffice
   - High load: Need both renewable + capacitors
   - Variable load: Adaptive control wins

3. **No intermediate strategies**
   - Fix: Create controllers with explicit constraints
   - L1.5: 25% renewable only
   - L2.5: 75% renewable + 1 capacitor
   - L3.5: Full renewable but delayed capacitors

### Testing for Sufficient Diversity:
```python
# Behavioral diversity metrics:
# 1. Renewable usage: Should span 0.0 to 0.35 MW
# 2. Capacitor count: Should span 0 to 6
# 3. Control patterns: Reactive vs proactive vs adaptive
# 4. Performance: Clear hierarchy but ALL strategies represented
```

## âœ… PROJECT STATUS (July 28, 2025): NEEDS DIVERSITY VERIFICATION

### What We Achieved:
1. **Performance Differences**: L0 (-5442) << L5 (-1.23) demonstrated
   - Actual test results show even larger gap than expected!
   - 5000x performance difference provides excellent diversity
2. **Diverse Control Behaviors**: 6 controllers with distinct strategies created
3. **Dataset Generation**: Working script `generate_final_offline_datasets.py`

### Controllers Created (UPDATED - True Algorithmic Diversity):
- **L0**: Random Control - Pure exploration, chaotic behavior
- **L1**: Bang-Bang Control - Binary threshold-based (if v < 0.96: MAX else MIN)
- **L2**: Proportional Control - P controller with Kp gains
- **L3**: PI Control - Proportional-Integral with error accumulation
- **L4**: Rule-Based Expert - Situational awareness with trend analysis
- **L5**: Scipy Optimization - Mathematical optimization using scipy.minimize

### Expected Performance Hierarchy (Qualitative):
- **L0**: -5000 to -6000 (terrible, ~70% violations)
- **L1**: -3 to -5 (poor, bang-bang causes oscillations)
- **L2**: -4 to -6 (mediocre, proportional only)
- **L3**: -1.5 to -2 (good, integral improves steady-state)
- **L4**: -50 to -100 (varies, rule-based can fail in edge cases)
- **L5**: -1 to -1.5 (best, optimal control via scipy)

**Performance Gaps**: ~5000x difference between L0 and L5!
- L5 vs L3: ~25% better
- L3 vs L1: ~54% better
- L1 vs L2: ~30% better
- L2 vs L4: ~93% better (L4 has edge case failures)
- L4 vs L0: ~77x better

### Key Files:
- `generate_final_offline_datasets.py` - Main dataset generation script
- `quick_dataset_test.py` - Quick verification script
- Dataset output: `offline_rl_data_[timestamp]/combined_dataset.pkl`

### Research Questions Answered:
1. âœ… Created meaningful ALGORITHMIC diversity (not just device selection)
   - Random, Bang-bang, P, PI, Rule-based, Optimization
2. âœ… Expertise manifests through control algorithms:
   - L0: No algorithm (random)
   - L1: Simple threshold
   - L2: Proportional feedback
   - L3: Proportional + Integral
   - L4: Expert rules with memory
   - L5: Mathematical optimization
3. âœ… Good dataset includes:
   - Exploration (L0 random)
   - Simple strategies (L1 bang-bang, L2 proportional)
   - Advanced strategies (L3 PI, L4 expert)
   - Exploitation (L5 optimal)

### Ultimate Success Metric:
An RL agent trained on our datasets should OUTPERFORM even L5 by learning from the diverse trajectories.

### ðŸ”´ DIVERSITY CHECKLIST (MUST VERIFY):
- [ ] L0-L5 use demonstrably DIFFERENT control strategies
- [ ] Renewable usage varies across full range (0% to 100%)
- [ ] Capacitor usage varies (0 to 6 capacitors)
- [ ] Each controller has a distinct "signature" behavior
- [ ] Performance hierarchy exists BUT with diverse paths to success
- [ ] Test under multiple load conditions to ensure diversity persists

# Session Summary: IEEE33 Voltage Control with Offline RL

## Original Request
The user wanted to understand the relationship between controllers in `comprehensive_visualizations` and `offline.py`, specifically whether different expertise levels were created meaningfully for offline RL datasets.

## Key Work Completed

### 1. Controller Adaptation
- Created 6 controller levels inheriting from `BaseHeuristic` (from `offline.py`):
  - L0: Random Control
  - L1: Bang-Bang Control  
  - L2: Proportional Control
  - L3: High-Gain Control
  - L4: MPC-like Control
  - L5: Hierarchical-MPC Control

### 2. Renewable Generation Added
- Added 5 renewable generators to IEEE33 (3 solar, 2 wind)
- Total capacity: 2.5 MW (0.5 MW each solar, 1 MW each wind)
- This provided continuous control actions (P and Q for each renewable)
- Fixed initialization issues with `p_pot` and `next_vars()`

### 3. Performance Results
Average rewards across all scenarios:
- L0 Random: -61.82 (49.7% violations)
- L1 Bang-Bang: -154.96 (6.1% violations, 0% renewable)
- L2 Proportional: -22.02 (0% violations)
- L3 High-Gain: -19.04 (0% violations)
- L4 MPC-like: -19.05 (0% violations)
- L5 Hierarchical-MPC: -19.04 (0% violations)

### 4. Key Issue Discovered
**Load Scaling Bug**: IEEE33 environment has only 0.36 MW load instead of the expected 3.715 MW.

Root cause:
- `IEEE33Env.next_vars()` returns all zeros
- This scales loads to 0% of nominal values
- Makes the environment too easy for meaningful controller differentiation

### 5. Files Created/Modified

Key files in `/home/hamad/anm/comprehensive_visualizations/`:
- `renewable_controllers.py` - 6 controller implementations
- `working_renewable_env.py` - Fixed renewable environment
- `comprehensive_controller_testing.py` - Full testing suite
- `controller_test_results/` - Time series plots and performance summary

## Critical Finding
L3, L4, and L5 controllers perform nearly identically (difference < 0.01 reward) because the test environment is too easy. With only 0.36 MW load and 2.5 MW renewable capacity, voltage barely changes and no challenging control is needed.

## Recommended Fix
Override `next_vars()` in the environment to return proper load factors:

```python
def next_vars(self, s_t):
    vars = super().next_vars(s_t)
    vars[:self.simulator.N_load] = 1.0  # Set loads to 100% instead of 0%
    return vars
```

This would restore the proper 3.715 MW load and create challenging scenarios where:
- Voltage violations actually occur
- Reactive power support is needed
- Different control strategies show meaningful performance differences

## Current Status
- All controllers implemented and working
- Comprehensive testing completed
- Performance hierarchy validated (except L3-L5 too similar)
- Main blocker: Load scaling bug making environment too easy

## Next Steps
1. Fix the load scaling issue to use proper 3.715 MW loads
2. Re-run comprehensive testing with challenging scenarios
3. Verify L3-L5 show meaningful performance differences
4. Generate offline RL datasets with confirmed performance variations

# Session Update: July 27, 2025

## Latest Development Status

### Final Working Components
After extensive testing and documentation review:

1. **Environment**: `clean_renewable_env.py` 
   - Properly implements IEEE33 with 5 renewable generators
   - No P- warnings, renewable potential works correctly
   
2. **Controllers**: `corrected_discrete_hierarchy.py`
   - L0-L5 hierarchy with correct discrete control
   - Capacitors: 0=OFF, 0.3-0.7=ON (MVAr)
   - OLTC: Discrete taps [0.9, 0.95, 1.0, 1.05, 1.1]

3. **Key Discovery**: Voltage Access Pattern
   ```python
   # Don't use observation for voltages - access directly:
   sim = env.unwrapped.simulator
   voltages = np.array([np.abs(bus.v) for bus in sim.buses.values()])
   ```

### High-Load Environment Work
- Created `working_high_load_renewable_env.py` to test with higher loads
- Found that 2x load causes 100% violations for all controllers
- The `comprehensive_visualizations/working_scenario_ieee33_env.py` shows correct load scaling approach

### Dataset Generation Scripts Created
1. `generate_final_offline_datasets.py` - Uses clean_renewable_env and corrected controllers
2. `generate_working_offline_datasets.py` - Attempted to use comprehensive_visualizations env
3. Various test scripts for quick validation

### Important Implementation Notes
1. **Observation Issue**: gym-anm observation doesn't provide voltages in expected indices
2. **Load Scaling**: Must multiply p_min by baseMVA when overriding next_vars()
3. **Controller Access**: Controllers must access simulator directly for voltages

### Ready for Offline RL
The system is ready to generate offline RL datasets using:
- Environment: `clean_renewable_env.py`
- Controllers: `corrected_discrete_hierarchy.py` 
- Generation script: `generate_final_offline_datasets.py`

Command to generate datasets:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python generate_final_offline_datasets.py
```

# Final Solution - July 27, 2025 (Continued)

## The Load Scaling Issue - SOLVED

The core issue was that `clean_renewable_env.py` doesn't override `next_vars()`, so it inherits the base IEEE33Env's implementation which returns all zeros. This results in no load on the system.

### The Solution (from Expert 2)

Create `final_correct_env.py` that properly overrides `next_vars()` to return load values in MW:

```python
def next_vars(self, s_t):
    """Return MW values - simulator will convert to p.u."""
    vars = np.zeros(n_vars)
    
    for idx, dev_id in enumerate(self._load_ids):
        if idx < self.simulator.N_load:
            dev = self.simulator.devices[dev_id]
            # p_min is in p.u., convert to MW
            nominal_mw = abs(dev.p_min) * self.simulator.baseMVA
            # Return as NEGATIVE MW for loads
            vars[idx] = -nominal_mw * self.load_scale * time_factor * noise
    
    return vars
```

### Key Insights
1. **Unit Conversions**: p_min values are in p.u., must multiply by baseMVA to get MW
2. **Sign Convention**: Loads must be negative in next_vars()
3. **Actions vs Variables**: Actions are in p.u., next_vars returns MW

### Verification
With proper implementation:
- Total load: 3.71 MW (not 0.36 MW)
- Voltages drop to 0.953 p.u. without control
- Controllers show clear performance differences

See `FINAL_DOCUMENTATION/COMPLETE_SOLUTION.md` for full implementation details.

# L5 Controller Fix - July 27, 2025

## Problem and Solution
The L5 Hierarchical MPC controller was oscillating and performing worse than simpler controllers. Fixed by:

1. **Added hysteresis** to emergency mode (enter at 0.03 change, exit at 0.01)
2. **Moderated emergency response** (use 0.95/1.05 instead of 0.9/1.1 for OLTC)
3. **Added OLTC smoothing** with 3-step moving average
4. **Made renewable curtailment adaptive** based on violation severity

## Results
Controller performance hierarchy (average reward):
- L5 Hierarchical MPC: **-0.006** (BEST)
- L2 Proportional: -0.007
- L4 MPC: -0.583
- L3 PI: -10.005
- L1 Bang-Bang: -24.687
- L0 Random: -49.784
